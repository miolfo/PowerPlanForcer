# PowerPlanForcer
A very simple script to automatically force Windows power plan to preferred every N seconds. Script created since Oculus Rift always wants to force high performance plan on, which prevents Ryzen CPUs automatic clock boost from working properly. Usually Oculus Rift changes the power plan when Oculus Home is started, or when Oculus detects that the headset is removed or put on, so a very frequent delay is not necessary.

## Usage
Change delay value to adjust how often the script is run, and update desired_plan_name variable to set the name of the desired plan. Name is case sensitive!
